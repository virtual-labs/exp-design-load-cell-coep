### Basic Knowledge :
- Select the type of load cell from the options at the top
- Answer all the questions and click on "Submit Test" button
- Click on "Next Level"

### Configuration :
- Select the configuration parameters
- If column type load cell selected then, calculate area and enter its value if the value is correct, click on Configure. If the entered value is incorrect then formula followed by correct answer will be displayed after 3 attempts 
- Click on "Next Level"

### Construction of Wheatstone bridge :
- Click on a component from the left panel to select it. The selected component will appear on the right, where you can drag and drop the component to adjust its position
- You can select any component or connection and click the delete button to modify it, if needed
- Use drag-and-drop to connect the ports and construct the Wheatstone bridge
- After completing the connections, click the "Validate Connection" button to check them. If the connections are incorrect three times, a popup will notify you, and on the fourth attempt, a hint will be displayed. Once the connections are correct, you'll be redirected to the next page 

### Calculations : 
- Enter a load between 1000 and 10000 N for the column-type load cell, and for the cantilever-type load cell, the load range is between 10 and 100 N
- Calculate Axial Strain and enter it's value if the value is correct further calculations will be enabled and if the value is incorrect then formula followed by correct answer will be displayed after 3 attempts
- Calculate transverse strain and enter it's value, if the value is correct further calculations will be enabled and if the value is incorrect then formula followed by correct answer will be displayed after 3 attempts
- Repeat the same process for different loads and calculate axial and tranverse strain. Calculate the load for 5 readings and click on next level
- Select one of the load to calculate output voltage and click on submit
- Select the supply voltage Eb and click "Submit." Note that this selection cannot be changed for next readings
- Calculate the output voltage and enter it's value if the value is correct further calculations will be enabled and if the value is incorrect then formula followed by correct answer will be displayed after 3 attempts
- Now, calculate the same for the other applied loads
- Click on "Next Level" button

### Characterization :
- Select any load for which you want to calculate the error and sensitivity
- Calculate the error for the selected load (error = standard reading - actual reading)
- Calculate the sensitivity (sensitivity = actual output / Input)
- After submitting the correct value for sensitivity, click on "Result" button for analysis
